I've made a small sample project, with bugs and tasks that I collected from applications public bug trackers (Firefox, Inkscape, MariaDB and Kodi).

# How To Use

First you need to create a new project:

A project has issues and tasks.

*image issues*  *image tasks*

Issues are bugs/problems, tasks is a simple to do list (other issue trackers mix them but I prefer to have them in separate views).

## Show/hide columns

Using the **Configure Columns** window the user can select which columns to show:

## Sorting

You can sort the rows in the grids, in two ways:

- Click on a column header
- Use the **Configure Columns** window




## Exporting

MiniBug has an option for exporting the issues and tasks of a project, to CSV (comma separated values).

To export, type a filename for the issues and tasks .CSV files, select a location to export and hit export.

After the export operation, a window presents the result of the operation. If errors were encountered, the details of the error(s) and possible solutions are presented.
